# Copy Trait
Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack, as integers are. 

>If a type `implements` the `Copy` trait, *variables that use it do not move*, but rather are *trivially copied*, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.

>Rust wonâ€™t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait. 

### Here are some of the types that implement Copy:

- All the `integer` types, such as u32.
- The `Boolean` type, bool, with values true and false.
- All the `floating-point types`, such as f64.
- The `character` type, char.
- `Tuples`, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.
