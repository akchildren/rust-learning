# Conditionals

## If expressions (statement)
An `if` expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

All `if expressions` start with the keyword `if`, followed by a `condition`.

Optionally, we can also include an `else` expression, which we chose to do here, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute should the condition evaluate to false. If you donâ€™t provide an else expression and the condition is false, the program will just skip the if block and move on to the next bit of code.

*Conditions to a if statement **MUST** be a boolean.*

### else if

You can use multiple conditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if` expression. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

Using too many else if expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor your code. **Rust branching construct called `match` for these cases.**

### If statement assigned to Let varriable
Because `if` is an `expression`, we can use it on the right side of a let statement to assign the outcome to a variable, as in Listing 3-2.

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```
